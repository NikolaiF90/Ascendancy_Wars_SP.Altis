## Story

> _"If you work in a profession where people die young, make sure you don't die young"_

_"Altis, a once prosperous and peaceful island, has fallen into the clutches of ruthless cartel groups, aided by the powerful CSAT forces. The people of Altis have suffered greatly under their oppressive rule, their lives torn apart by violence and fear._  
 
_In this desperate time, the Altis Armed Forces (AAF) have joined forces with NATO, signing a historic agreement to liberate the island and restore peace. The AAF and NATO, recognizing the importance of player involvement, have selected a group of skilled operatives to lead the mission._  
 
_Your team, codenamed Task Force Phoenix, is deployed deep within enemy territory. Your objective is to disrupt the cartel's operations, weaken their forces, and gather vital intelligence. The success of your mission will determine the fate of Altis._  
 
_As you navigate through treacherous terrain and engage in intense firefights, the choices you make will have far-reaching consequences. Will you prioritize stealth and gather intel covertly, or unleash all-out assaults to cripple the cartel's defenses? Each decision you make will shape the course of the mission and impact the lives of the island's inhabitants._  
 
_Along the way, you'll encounter civilians caught in the crossfire, resistance fighters eager to join your cause, and enemy informants willing to betray their comrades. How you interact with these individuals and handle delicate situations will influence the loyalty of local factions and shape the future of Altis._  
 
_Be prepared for unexpected challenges and moral dilemmas as you delve deeper into the heart of the cartel's operations. Your actions will not only determine the fate of Altis but also the lives of your fellow soldiers and the trust placed in you by the AAF and NATO._ 
 
_Remember, every choice matters. The outcome of this mission rests in your hands. Will you lead Altis towards a brighter future or succumb to the darkness that has plagued the island for far too long? The fate of Altis is yours to decide."_

### Why Ascendancy Wars?

Ascendancy Wars was created hugely inspired by popular mods like Antistasi, Overthow and Vindicta.
I first create this project because I feel some of the mentioned mods lacks some features, like something in Antistasi doesn't exist in Vindicta or vice versa.
I know they make their mision/mod different from others is to make them unique from others. But sometimes, the lack of some features make the mission feels incomplete.
So I make Ascendancy Wars combining their features, but different too at the same time.  

What is the difference? Let's take a look at features.

### Features
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Roadmap-teal?style=plastic)](https://github.com/NikolaiF90/AWSPDocs/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

* Zoning And Garrisoning System (ZAGS) 
  - Engage in strategic gameplay by capturing and controlling zones on the map. Gain control over important areas to weaken the enemy's hold and expand your influence.
  - ZAGS is the core feature of Ascendancy Wars, creating dynamic zones across the map for players to capture and conquer.
  - Prepare for a fierce counter-attack from the enemy commander upon capturing their zone, as they won't remain idle.
  - Each zone will be garrisoned with varying numbers of troops, which depend on available resources rather than a uniform distribution. 
  - To optimize game performance and memory usage, garrisoned troops will only spawn when players or opposing enemies approach the zone, ensuring a seamless and immersive experience.

* Conflict Dynamics and Adversarial Response System (CDARS) 
  - Experience a truly immersive and responsive battlefield, where their choices and achievements shape the enemy's behavior and ultimately determine the outcome of the mission. 
  - CDARS is an innovative system that revolutionizes the way player actions impact the enemy's perception and behavior.  
  - This dynamic system tracks and manages player bounties, reflecting the level of animosity the enemy holds towards the player based on a wide range of action such as attacking outposts, military bases, and airports, capturing prisoners, eliminating high-ranking officers, and even accounting for inaction. 
  - The system goes beyond mere numerical values, offering a comprehensive view of the enemy's reaction and actions over time.

* Blend in with the civilian population to gather intel, carry out covert operations, and avoid detection by enemy forces. Utilize disguises to move unnoticed through hostile territories. 

* Keep the action going with a dynamic revive system that allows players to revive fallen teammates. Work together to ensure the survival of your squad and complete mission objectives.

* Experience realistic combat situations with an incapacitated bleedout system. React quickly to stabilize wounded teammates and prevent them from bleeding out. 

* Immerse yourself in realistic warfare as enemies may surrender when overwhelmed or outgunned. Decide whether to take them as prisoners or eliminate them. 

* Interact with a weapon dealer to access a wide range of firearms, attachments, and equipment. Upgrade your arsenal and customize your loadout according to mission requirements. 

* Utilize a vehicle garage to store and manage your acquired vehicles. Access your fleet easily and efficiently during missions. 

* Access a variety of vehicles strategically placed throughout towns and bases. Utilize these vehicles to enhance mobility, firepower, and tactical options during missions. 

* Unlock the ability to purchase vehicles, including armored vehicles and helicopters, to bolster your combat effectiveness and mobility. 

* Progress through a comprehensive ranking system that tracks your performance and achievements. Unlock new abilities, equipment, and command options as you rise through the ranks. 

* Engage in optional side missions to earn additional rewards, gather intelligence, and disrupt enemy operations. Explore the diverse challenges and opportunities Altis has to offer. 

* Call in air supply drops to receive crucial resources, ammunition, and equipment during missions. Coordinate logistics and ensure your supplies are delivered safely. 

* Access an extensive arsenal of weapons, attachments, and gear to tailor your loadout for each mission. Equip yourself with the tools necessary to overcome any obstacle. 

* Establish and fortify your own base of operations. Construct defensive structures, command centers, and resource-generating facilities to support your mission objectives. 

### Dependencies

* CBA
* Real Engine (Optional)
* But note that this mission is Single-Player only. Multiplayer needs to be reconsidered if ones requested. But for now, it is all about you yourself.
