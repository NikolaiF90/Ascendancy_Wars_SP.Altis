## Getting Started

Not yet implemented

### Why Ascendancy Wars?

Ascendancy Wars was created hugely inspired by popular mods like Antistasi, Overthow and Vindicta.
I first create this project because I feel some of the mentioned mods lacks some features, like something in Antistasi doesn't exist in Vindicta or vice versa.
I know they make their mision/mod different from others is to make them unique from others. But sometimes, the lack of some features make the mission feels incomplete.
So I make Ascendancy Wars combining their features, but different too at the same time.

What is the difference?
* For others, it is guerrila simulator. But for Ascendancy Wars, it is war simulation.
  Be a spy, launch attacks from inside based on intels, recruit citizens from Altis, or you can recruit soldiers from your army to fight by your side.
  But in the end, its all about revolution.
* more.. I will add in the future

### Features
* Choose whether to recruit local population, or recruit army from your HQ
* More features to be added in the future. See [Roadmap](https://github.com/NikolaiF90/Ascendancy_Wars_SP.Altis/blob/Alpha/ROADMAP.md)

### Dependencies
