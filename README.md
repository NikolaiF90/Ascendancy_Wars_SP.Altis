## Story

_"In the war-torn land of Altis, the citizens have long suffered under the oppressive rule of CSAT, a government that has failed to meet even their most basic needs. As the proud nation of Livonia, renowned for its strength and resilience, you have decided to take matters into your own hands.

The stakes are high, and the odds seem insurmountable. But armed with your wits, determination, and the support of fellow Livonian operatives, you embark on a treacherous journey. Every step taken brings you closer to the heart of Altis, where the fate of an entire nation hangs in the balance.  
As you navigate the bustling streets and shadowy alleys, you must not only evade the watchful eyes of CSAT but also win the trust and loyalty of Altis' weary citizens. Show them a glimmer of hope, offer them a chance at a brighter future, and they may rise up alongside you, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for their freedom.  
The path to victory will be fraught with danger, requiring strategic thinking, precise execution, and a deep understanding of the human spirit. Your actions will shape the destiny of Altis and leave an indelible mark on its history.  
Will you be the hero that Altis needs? Will you lead a nation towards liberation, defying the odds and inspiring others to join your cause? The stage is set, the mission awaits.

### Why Ascendancy Wars?

Ascendancy Wars was created hugely inspired by popular mods like Antistasi, Overthow and Vindicta.
I first create this project because I feel some of the mentioned mods lacks some features, like something in Antistasi doesn't exist in Vindicta or vice versa.
I know they make their mision/mod different from others is to make them unique from others. But sometimes, the lack of some features make the mission feels incomplete.
So I make Ascendancy Wars combining their features, but different too at the same time.

What is the difference?
* For others, it is guerrila simulator. But for Ascendancy Wars, it is war simulation.
  Be a spy, launch attacks from inside based on intels, recruit citizens from Altis, or you can recruit soldiers from your army to fight by your side.
  But in the end, its all about revolution.
* more.. I will add in the future

### Features
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Roadmap-teal?style=plastic)](ROADMAP.md)

* Choose whether to recruit local population, or recruit army from your HQ

* Conflict Dynamics and Adversarial Response System  
  CDARS is an innovative system that revolutionizes the way player actions impact the enemy's perception and behavior.  
  This dynamic system tracks and manages player bounties, reflecting the level of animosity the enemy holds towards  
  the player based on a wide range of actions such as attacking outposts, military bases, and airports, capturing prisoners,  
  eliminating high-ranking officers, and even accounting for inaction. The system goes beyond mere numerical values,  
  offering a comprehensive view of the enemy's reaction and actions over time. With CDARS, players can experience a truly  
  immersive and responsive battlefield, where their choices and achievements shape the enemy's behavior and ultimately  
  determine the outcome of the mission


### Dependencies

* CBA
* Real Engine (Optional)
* But note that this mission is Single-Player only. Multiplayer needs to be reconsidered if ones requested. But for now, it is all about you yourself.
