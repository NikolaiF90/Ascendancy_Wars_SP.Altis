Conflict Dynamics and Adversarial Response System (CDARS) is an innovative system designed for Arma 3 missions that revolutionizes the way player actions impact the enemy's perception and behavior. This dynamic system tracks and manages player bounties, reflecting the level of animosity the enemy holds towards the player based on a wide range of actions such as attacking outposts, military bases, and airports, capturing prisoners, eliminating high-ranking officers, and even accounting for inaction. The system goes beyond mere numerical values, offering a comprehensive view of the enemy's reaction and actions over time. With CDARS, players can experience a truly immersive and responsive battlefield, where their choices and achievements shape the enemy's behavior and ultimately determine the outcome of the mission
